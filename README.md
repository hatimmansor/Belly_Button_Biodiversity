# Belly_Button_Biodiversity
In this project, I have build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonise human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

I have used a variety set of visualisation chart to present data:
* Bar Chart
* Bubble Chart
* Gauge Chart
* Panel
